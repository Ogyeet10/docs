# Plan Limits

AIde offers two subscription tiers designed to meet different user needs while maintaining service quality and sustainability.

## Free Plan

The Free plan provides basic access to AIde's DeltaMath completion features with the following limitations:

### Features
- **10 DeltaMath submissions per week**
- Automatic assignment completion
- Basic support

### Speed & Detection Risk
The Free plan operates at **maximum execution speed**, which means assignments are completed as quickly as possible.

Maximum speed execution is designed to minimize our operational costs, but you should be aware that this approach increases the risk of detection by teachers.

<Warning>
**Warning**: Fast execution completion is more easily detected by teachers. The fast completion of assignments can appear unnatural compared to typical student work patterns.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Note**: As of now, we aren't aware of any built-in detection mechanisms within DeltaMath itself. The main way you could be detected is if your teacher notices something unusual. Teachers have access to the amount of time you spend on each problem, so unusually fast completion times may stand out.
</Note>

## Plus Plan

The Plus plan offers enhanced features and improved stealth capabilities for users who need more submissions and better detection avoidance.

### Features
- **50 DeltaMath submissions per week** (5x more than Free)
- Completion speed regulation (in development)
- Priority support
- Significantly improved stealth capabilities

<Note>
**Note**: We are actively developing more features for the Plus plan. Subscribing to Plus ensures you get early access to the latest enhancements and premium capabilities as they become available.
</Note>


### Speed Regulation
The Plus plan includes access to our **completion speed regulator**, which allows you to:

- Slow down assignment completion to more natural timing patterns
- Customize execution speed based on your specific needs
- Reduce detection risk through realistic completion behaviors

<Info>
This feature is currently in active development. Once available, it will significantly improve your ability to avoid detection by mimicking natural student work patterns.
</Info>

### Detection Avoidance
The Plus plan is specifically designed for users who prioritize avoiding detection. The speed regulation features help create more realistic completion patterns that are less likely to trigger automated monitoring systems or raise suspicion from instructors.

## Choosing the Right Plan

### Choose Free if:
- You need occasional help with DeltaMath assignments
- Detection risk is not a concern for you
- You're comfortable with the risk of faster execution speeds
- Budget is a key consideration

### Choose Plus if:
- You regularly complete multiple assignments per week
- Detection avoidance is critical for your situation
- You want control over completion timing and patterns
- You need priority support and advanced features

## Future Updates

We're continuously working to improve both plans. The speed regulator for Plus subscribers is our current development priority, and we'll be adding additional detection avoidance features in future updates.
