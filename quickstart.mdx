## Best Practices

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Timing Considerations" icon="clock">
    **Free Plan**: Be aware that maximum speed completion may be more noticeable to teachers who monitor completion times.
    
    **Plus Plan**: Use speed regulation to match your typical work patterns when available.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Assignment Selection" icon="target">
    AIde works best on routine practice assignments rather than assessments that require original thinking or explanations.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Account Security" icon="shield">
    Never share your DeltaMath login credentials. AIde works by automating your browser session, not by accessing your account directly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Stay Updated" icon="bell">
    Follow our updates for new features, especially the Plus plan's speed regulator and future platform expansions.
