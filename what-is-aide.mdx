## The Name

AIde is a play on words combining **AI** (Artificial Intelligence) and **aide** (assistant). Just like a teaching aide helps in the classroom, AIde serves as your digital aide for handling repetitive academic tasks.

## What AIde Actually Does

At its core, AIde is an application designed to complete academic busywork in the most efficient and undetectable way possible. We focus on automating the repetitive, time-consuming assignments that don't contribute meaningfully to your learning - freeing you to focus on what actually matters for your education.

AIde handles the mechanical completion of assignments, allowing you to redirect your time and energy toward:
- Subjects and topics where you genuinely need improvement
- Creative projects and meaningful coursework  
- Real-world application of concepts you're learning
- Areas of study that align with your actual academic and career goals

## Platforms

**DeltaMath** is currently our only supported platform. We've invested significant time perfecting our DeltaMath integration to ensure reliable, undetectable completion of assignments across all math topics and difficulty levels.

## Future Expansion

We're actively working on expanding to additional educational platforms. While we can't make specific commitments about timelines or platforms, our goal is to support the most commonly assigned busywork platforms that students encounter.

Our expansion will always prioritize:
- Reliability and undetectable operation
- Comprehensive coverage of assignment types
- Maintaining the same high standards we've established with DeltaMath

## Who AIde Is For

AIde is designed for students who:
- Recognize the difference between meaningful learning and repetitive busywork
- Want to optimize their study time for maximum educational benefit
- Understand their own learning needs better than a standardized curriculum
- Value academic success but refuse to let busywork consume their lives

Whether you're managing a heavy course load, balancing work and school, or simply want to focus on learning that actually advances your understanding, AIde gives you back control over your academic time.

## Our Approach

We're not trying to replace learning - we're trying to optimize it. Every hour you spend on assignments you've already mastered is an hour you're not spending on concepts that could actually challenge and improve you.

AIde exists because we believe students deserve better than a one-size-fits-all approach to homework. You know where your weaknesses are, and you should have the freedom to focus your energy there.
